# Sdg4People
To help establish the People as the rightful stakeholders for SDG. States in collaboration with the People and NGOs can achieve Sustainable Development together!

SDG4People is an open source initiative sponsored by [Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation](https://www.khmerkrom.org) and the [Hawaii Institute For Human Rights](http://hawaii-institute-for-humanrights.org) with idea of empowering the People to drive the policy implementations for the [SDGs](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals). Built for people by people who are passionate about Human Rights and improving people's living conditions around the globe. 

We hope this tool makes dialogs and collaboration between People, their Government, and their NGO advocates easy, faster, and transparent. 

What This App Will Do: 

(1) At the heart of this tool is the ability for stakeholders (People) at the most local level to report a Need, corresponding to one of the 17 Development Goals. 

(2) For Government and NGOs to be able to have real-time data about those needs and where they are so they can develop strategies and policies to work with the local to address the specific needs

(3) For the People to rate their own government's response that would allow for better transparency and true accountability in of government works and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 and ensuring that no one gets left behind. 

(4) To provide data to advocates and policy makers and allow fact and need-based programs instead of pick-choose exhibition projects for presentation.

For the People by other People (amazing developers!) to help better our world; one village, one town, one city, one state, one country at a time!
